#+title: Braincore

* What is it?

[[./docs/braincore-screenshot.png]]

Braincore is an immutable daily log currently built against the
https://notion.so APIs. Every day an automated script creates an entry in a
Notion doc with the following 3 columns:

 1. Minor tasks or broad goals
 2. Summary of https://linear.app tickets
 3. General notes

Then when the next day passes, Github Actions will create a another entry by
running the create-entry command. The unfinished tasks from the day before
populate the next day's tasks column, generates a fresh linear ticket summary,
and creates a blank notes section. This format creates a running log that shows
when tasks started and completed, additionally it serves as a common inbox for
stashing links and notes before migrating them into a zettelkasten for permanent
storage later.

* Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Run ~yarn install~
3. Run ~yarn build~
4. RUn ~cp .env.example .env~
5. Edit the ~.env~ file and provide the expected API keys
6. Run ~node ./bin/braincore.js create-entry~

Note: The script reuses the headings from the previous section, so if you wish
to change them more to your liking, it should still work as long as the
structure of elements does not change.
